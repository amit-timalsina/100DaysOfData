**Day1 of 100DaysOfData!**
- On my journey of Machine learning and Deep Learning, Today I continued reading Chapter End-to-End Machine learning Project. After framing the problem, getting the data, exploring the data, sampling data into train and test set, and creating a whole transformation pipeline to clean up and prepare data for Machine Learning algorithms automatically, today I learned to select and train a Machine Learning Model using Scikit Learn. I am working on a District house price prediction model.  It is a multiple(more than one feature/attribute), univariate(only one value to predict) regression(based on all the attributes we have to predict a single value) supervised(labeled data) Machine Learning System.
-  I learned to select and train a Machine Learning Model using Scikit Learn, learned about various performance metrics, and learned little about the Linear Regression model, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor model. I also came across Cross-validation and using it easily from Scikit Learn.
